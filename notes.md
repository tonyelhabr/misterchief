## TODO

-   Figure out why `infobox` in `brackets` is nested

-   Standardize `infobox` somehow (maybe fix `series` -> `tier`)

-   Extract tournament urls in players data set (this will make it easier to join on tournaments)

-   Fix `tier` in `players` (harder)

-   Create `{haloreadr}` package

-   convert `prize_pool` in `bracket` to integer

-   take off `"-Tier"` in `liquipedia_tier` in `brackets`
